## Analysis of Weather vs Soybean Yields 2000 - 2022

## Summary 

This report sought to assess the impact of climate change on crop yields by analyzing weather data, soybean yields, and soybean prices between 2000 and 2022 for the Top 11 soybean producing States. Data was obtained from public sources at USDA, NOAA, and FAO.

Linear regressions were performed to assess the relationship between:

- Max, mean, and min temperatures and soybean yield, 
- Precipitation and soybean yield
- Soybean yield and soybean price

The analysis determined the following:

- Precipitation was strongly correlated to yield and accounted for 67% of yield variation. 
- Yield was moderately correlated to soybean price and accounted for 17% of price variation.
- Max, mean, and min temperatures were not correlated to yield (nearly zero correlation)
